Currently we can select files from the database by release, or even go to these
links

    https://desar.cosmology.illinois.edu/DESFiles/desardata/Release/$RELEASE/

However, when we are in the middle of a run we won't have an official release
of red and coadd images.  Rather we will have nites.  There could be many
different processings of a given nite.  At the beginning these could
appear in rapid succession as bugs are squashed and features added.

How will we know when a nite is ready to download?  

Should we instead expect a "rolling release" situation?  For example, perhaps
we can monitor the database for "red" and "coadd" runs that are marked as
ready?
